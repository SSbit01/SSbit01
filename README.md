# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

## I'm  ***Stefan Samson***, also known as [SSbit01][portfolio]

A young **self-taught developer** who loves to **learn** and **try out** the **latest technologies**.

Capable of developing **full-stack web applications** and doing some **data analysis** and **visualization** with *Python* and *JavaScript* (or *TypeScript*).

I've always been curious about **science** and **technology**. *Python* was my first programming language, which I taught myself at the age of 12. Shortly after, I became interested in **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**, which I'm still learning.

I was also interested in **Web Development** and **Communications**; I learned *front-end* and *back-end* technologies that allowed me to create exciting projects.

Take a look at my [**portfolio** website][portfolio] to know much more about me.
