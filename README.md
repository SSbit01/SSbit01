# âœ‹ Stop where you are! Let me introduce myself ðŸ¤ 

## I'm  ***Stefan Samson***, also known as [SSbit01][portfolio]

A **passionate** and young **self-taught developer** who enjoys exploring and trying out the **latest technologies**.

Capable of developing **full-stack web applications** and performing **data analysis** and **visualization** using Python and JavaScript (or TypeScript).

My curiosity for science and technology led me to learn Python as my first programming language at the age of 12. Shortly after, I became interested in **Data Science**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Physics**, which I'm still learning.

I also have a keen interest in **Web Development** and **Communications**; I've mastered front-end and back-end technologies that enabled me to create exciting projects.

Take a look at my [website][portfolio] to know much more about me.
