# 👋 Hello World

## I’m  ***Stefan Samson***, also known as [SSbit01][portfolio]

👀 I've always been curious about **science** and **technology**. I started programming with **🐍Python** when I was 12 years old, which I taught myself. Shortly after, I became interested in **📊Data Science** and **🤖Artificial Intelligence**, which I'm still learning.

I was also interested in **🌐Web Development** and **📡Communications**; I learned *front-end* and *back-end* technologies that allowed me to create exciting projects.

Take a look at my [**portfolio** website][portfolio] to know much more about me.
